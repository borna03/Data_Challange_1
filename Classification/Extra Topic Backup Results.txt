Precision = predicted topic correct / amount of times a topic was predicted
Recall = predicted topic correct / amount of true (labeled) topic classifications
Support = amount of true (labeled) topic classifications
So good precision, but bad recall ==> model doesn't recognize a topic often, but when it does, it does so correctly
So good recall, but bad precision ==> model predicts this topic too much, therefore also gets it right when it's the actual topic
